# DnD-statistics
A webscraping program reading the die throws from DnD Beyond, categorizes them and calculate statistics on them.

Essentially, DnD Beyond is a powerful website for DnD sessions, but they have no APIs to make use of. So, in order to obtain data behind an account, it is necessary to use webscraping. This brings a plethora of new problems for me, but which i'll try my darndest to solve.

My initial thoughts are to make the program an extension to be downloaded with Chrome Web Store, allowing the extension to be online at the same time as the GM is on and thereby collecting regularly the new dice rolls.
